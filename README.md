# 100-Day-Data-Science-Plan-Building-A-Data-Strategy



Project Setup
Before beginning the project, please download the project templates from the lesson resources. The document template also contains the project instructions so I can work directly in that document without having to refer back to these instructions.

Templates to download (Please rename these templates to include my name Ex: Phil Fuller DSBL Project.docx):

DSBL Project Template
DSBL CEO Presentation Template
Resources are available in the navigation panel on the left side of the screen. I may need to click the three lines to show the menu if it's hidden.

These documents are saved in .docx and Powerpoint format but can be opened in any document application. If I want to use Google Docs or if I don't have Microsoft Office, please follow the direction below:

Upload the files into Google Drive
Click on the file and choose Open With
Select Google Docs for the .docx and Google Slides for the slide deck.
If the file opens in Google Drive's Compatibility Mode, indicated by a Docs or PowerPoint icon in the top right,
Click on File in the Menu Bar
Click Save as Google Docs or Google Slides
Google will convert the file, and I should be good to go.
If I have other documents software or use MS Office, the files should open in that software as well, but I will need to consult the documentation for that software in order to create the visualizations in this project for my software as the steps may be different from Google.

Project Steps
Step 1 - Identify Data Science Opportunities in the Business
Throughout the course, I have been exposed to multiple examples of data science projects implemented in a business setting. Now, based on my knowledge of my specific business context, I will generate at least six potential projects to be considered by the executive leadership team. These projects must span three unique functional areas of the business, with any single functional area representing no more than 3 projects:

Acceptable Project Mixes
2 marketing + 2 supply chain + 2 finance
2 marketing + 1 human resources + 1 procurement + 1 product + 1 manufacturing
3 finance + 1 legal + 2 marketing
Unacceptable Project Mixes:

3 marketing + 3 finance
4 marketing + 1 product + 1 manufacturing
For each candidate project, I should provide the following detail in the “Project Specification” workbook:

Description of the project
Business problem to be addressed
Role of data science in addressing the business problem
Targeted business objective(s)
Data Science Classification
Approach
Type of Model
Data needed for the project and sources for that data
The magnitude of opportunity (with justification)
Cost and complexity of development and implementation
Likelihood of value capture
Key Business Stakeholders

Step 2 - Developing a Roadmap: Prioritizing Data Science Opportunities in the Business
A strategic approach to data science requires the business to consider the relative opportunities, costs, and risks of potential projects to identify the best order to carry out the projects. What should be tackled first? What is best pushed off until later? Completing the Data Science Roadmap requires stepping through key considerations to determine which project(s) should be considered ‘top priority' and at what pace these and subsequent projects should be initiated.

Complete this “Rack and Stack Exercise” worksheet to determine the strategic alignment, cost, complexity of implementation, certainty of value capture, and magnitude of benefit for each of the six projects
Complete the Data Science Opportunity Matrix, using slide 1 of the CEO Presentation Template (I may or may not decide to include this slide as part of my CEO presentation)
Based on the information I prepared for #1, complete the “Data Science Roadmap” to capture the relative order and timing with which I would recommend the business carry out
# Step 3 - Establishing a Data Science Human Capital Strategy for your Data-driven Business

Now that we have established a roadmap for carrying out data science projects, our attention must turn to build and configure the organization we will leverage to carry out this roadmap. The Data Science Human Capital Plan completed in this step will cover the organizational structure and talent configuration best suited to carry out the business’s roadmap, as well as the activities that the organization in particular -- and business more broadly -- must complete in order to promote a data-driven culture throughout the business.

Identify the organizational model best suited for the data science organization at your company.
Complete the “Human Capital Plan” Worksheet for your data science organization.
Identify the first ten professional roles for which you would recruit. How would you organize these roles into teams within the organization?
Assume that leadership will allocate four new FTE’s for your data science organization during the current fiscal year. How would you prioritize your organizational buildout?
Craft a “Data-Driven Transformation Strategy” by identifying six specific initiatives that you would recommend the data science organization and/or the business undertakes in order to promote a data-driven culture across the business.

# Step 4 - Establishing the Technical Infrastructure to Support the Data Science Organization

With a completed Data Science Roadmap and a Human Capital Plan for executing the data science strategy, we turn our attention to the technological capabilities that must be built to support the new Data Science organization.

Prepare a strategy that your business might consider to meet its Data and Data Architecture needs (use the “Data and Data Architecture Strategy” template provided in the resources to record your strategy).
